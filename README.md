# FinTech-Mod7-Challenge

Files for Module 7 Challenge for FinTech Bootcamp

This is a Jupyter Notebook which demonstrates the use of SQL commands within a python notebook to generate a brief analysis of an ETF portfolio.

## Technologies

Languages:
* Python 3.7

Packages:
* Pandas - For data cleaning, processing, and visualization.
* Numpy - For data analysis and calculation.
* Path - To read data from CSV files.
* Sqlalchemy - To read data in SQL and perform SQL actions in a Python notebook.
* Voila - To create a web app based on an iPynb.

## Installation Guide

To repeat the analysis on your own machine, simply open the Jupyter notebok in a web browser and run each cell. This will provide data analysis as well as visualization through a variety of graphs.

## Contributors
